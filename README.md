Export plan:

The final export of the SemantiPress plugin will be structured to ensure easy installation, modular maintenance, and WordPress repository compliance.

📦 **Steps in Export Plan:**

1. **Code Finalization:**
   - Final review of all PHP, JS, and CSS files
   - Ensure consistent file naming and structure
   - Remove commented test code, sample data, and console logs

2. **Folder Structure:**
   - `semantipress/`
     ├─ `assets/` → CSS, JS, images
     ├─ `includes/` → core PHP classes & functions
     ├─ `admin/` → settings, tools UI
     ├─ `public/` → frontend hooks (schema, alt text, etc.)
     ├─ `languages/` → .pot file for translation
     ├─ `templates/` → HTML/JS templates
     └─ `semantipress.php` → main plugin file

3. **Readme & License Files:**
   - `readme.txt` (WordPress.org format)
   - `LICENSE` (GPL v2 or v3)

4. **Translation Ready:**
   - Load text domain
   - Include `.pot` file under `/languages`

5. **Minification & Optimization:**
   - Minify CSS/JS for production build
   - Only load scripts/styles conditionally per admin screen

6. **Zipping & Testing:**
   - Create `.zip` package for upload to WP Admin or distribution
   - Test install on clean WordPress instance (local + staging)
   - Confirm all tools run without PHP notices/warnings

7. **Backup & Version Tagging:**
   - Tag version (e.g., 1.0.0)
   - Keep changelog for internal and public release notes

Once zipped, this version is ready for: manual distribution, WP plugin repo upload, or licensing-based auto-updater integration.


  
Plugin packaging structure:

The final plugin folder `semantipress/` will be organized for modularity, performance, and maintainability:

```
semantipress/
├── admin/                     # Admin dashboard pages and tool UIs
│   ├── pages/
│   └── partials/
├── assets/                   # Static assets (CSS, JS, images)
│   ├── css/
│   ├── js/
│   └── img/
├── includes/                 # Core logic: helpers, license, upgrades
│   ├── class-activator.php
│   ├── class-deactivator.php
│   └── helpers.php
├── languages/                # Translations (.pot, .mo, .po files)

│   ├── schema/
│   └── filters/
├── templates/                # Reusable HTML blocks for tools and settings
├── uninstall.php             # Cleanup on plugin uninstall

├── readme.txt                # WP.org standard plugin description
└── LICENSE                   # GPLv2 or GPLv3 license
```

✅ Notes:
- All features are split by concern: admin vs public
- Assets are versioned and conditionally loaded
- Translation-ready and WordPress.org compliant
- Ready for zipped packaging and WP repo submission


Development Ideas:

Here are future-focused ideas to evolve SemantiPress into a more powerful and user-centric plugin ecosystem:

🧠 AI-Powered Suggestions (Offline-First)
Add support for downloadable AI models (e.g., TinyML, ONNX in browser) for LSI & entity enhancement

🧩 Block-Based Output Templates
Create Gutenberg blocks for FAQ, Schema Preview, Topic Maps — all SEO-structured

🔗 Smart Link Graph Visualizer
Visual graph of internal links based on semantic match + click-to-edit

📦 Export to Content Brief / Writer Mode
Export keyword, gaps, topic clusters into a brief-style PDF or Google Doc — great for teams and content agencies

📈 SEO Snapshot Dashboard Widget
Add summary insights to the main WP Dashboard: content health, structured coverage, missing schema alerts

🌐 Multilingual Support & Entity Locale Map
Add multi-language entity parsing using custom lexicons per region

🛠️ Tool API Endpoints
Create REST API endpoints to allow headless integration (e.g., with Notion, SaaS writers, etc.)

🎯 Custom Post Type Support
Extend all tool compatibility beyond Posts/Pages to CPTs (Courses, Docs, etc.)

📊 User Insights + Reporting
Basic reporting per post: what’s missing, what’s linked, what’s semantically thin

🔐 Plugin-as-a-Service
Optional remote dashboard, license-based SaaS version with cloud sync


Instruction for Cursor AI to build this plugin:

1. **Read the full document top to bottom** to understand the plugin's functionality, UI, logic, and flow. This document contains everything from feature breakdowns to UI descriptions and development structure.

2. **Set up the plugin structure** using the "Plugin packaging structure" section as the root folder layout. Use proper modular separation (admin/public/includes/assets/etc.).

3. **For each tool listed in Tools Lists (1–10):**
   - Follow its "Text", "User Flow", "UI", and "Function" definitions.
   - Build the backend logic using WordPress hooks and local PHP logic (no external APIs unless noted).
   - Create admin page UI under `/admin/pages/` using WP native UI components.

4. **Implement the Dashboard Layout** by stacking sections defined under "Dashboard layout".
   - Reuse template parts via `/templates/`
   - Apply design cues from the UI descriptions

5. **Build the Settings UI** using tabbed interfaces defined in "Plugin Settings UI"
   - Save options to WP options table

6. **Frontend Output** is to be handled through proper use of `add_action('wp_head')`, `the_content` filter, and media alt injection logic — as per the "Frontend Output integration" section.

7. **Add upgrade logic** by showing Pro-locked tools (with blur or lock icon), and follow the "Upgrade to Pro Flow" for licensing and feature activation.

8. **Create modal-based onboarding and email capture** using `admin_notices` or modal overlay with dismiss/save preference.

9. **Document everything** and maintain proper code comments. Keep the system API-free wherever mentioned, and ensure everything is translation-ready.

10. **Test across different WordPress versions** and environments before packaging.

⚙️ Output must be:
- API-Free (unless stated otherwise)
- Lightweight
- Modular
- Fully functional in admin with WP best practices
- Compatible with block and classic editor

🧠 Cursor AI should treat this like a full product scope — build smart, keep lean, and modularize for scaling.
