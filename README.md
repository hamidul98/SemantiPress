Instruction for Cursor AI to build this plugin:

1. **Read the full document top to bottom** to understand the plugin's functionality, UI, logic, and flow. This document contains everything from feature breakdowns to UI descriptions and development structure.

2. **Set up the plugin structure** using the "Plugin packaging structure" section as the root folder layout. Use proper modular separation (admin/public/includes/assets/etc.).

3. **For each tool listed in Tools Lists (1‚Äì10):**
   - Follow its "Text", "User Flow", "UI", and "Function" definitions.
   - Build the backend logic using WordPress hooks and local PHP logic (no external APIs unless noted).
   - Create admin page UI under `/admin/pages/` using WP native UI components.

4. **Implement the Dashboard Layout** by stacking sections defined under "Dashboard layout".
   - Reuse template parts via `/templates/`
   - Apply design cues from the UI descriptions

5. **Build the Settings UI** using tabbed interfaces defined in "Plugin Settings UI"
   - Save options to WP options table

6. **Frontend Output** is to be handled through proper use of `add_action('wp_head')`, `the_content` filter, and media alt injection logic ‚Äî as per the "Frontend Output integration" section.

7. **Add upgrade logic** by showing Pro-locked tools (with blur or lock icon), and follow the "Upgrade to Pro Flow" for licensing and feature activation.
